I build automation that helps operators protect data, understand their systems, and use AI with explicit controls. My work connects infrastructure and recovery experience with practical **Python, PowerShell, and Rust** engineering.

## Featured projects

### [CyClaw](https://github.com/cgfixit/CyClaw) · local AI with explicit controls

An offline-first AI backend for querying a local knowledge base, with retrieval before generation and a governed coding workflow for real repositories.

- **Control the request path:** hybrid search combines semantic and keyword retrieval; LangGraph routes requests through explicit confirmation and audit steps.
- **Keep changes reviewable:** the optional coding harness separates patching, verification, human approval, pushing, and draft-PR creation.
- **Make state inspectable:** audit logs and integrity checks, plus optional user accounts and a memory store with proposal/apply controls. The coding layer, accounts, and memory ship disabled.

**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · LangGraph · ChromaDB · BM25/RRF · Ollama · SQLite · MCP<br />
[Architecture](https://github.com/cgfixit/CyClaw#architecture) · [Setup guide](https://github.com/cgfixit/CyClaw/blob/main/setup-guide.md) · [Tests](https://github.com/cgfixit/CyClaw/tree/main/tests)

<sub>CyClawOS is a browser simulation of the interface and workflows; the Python backend is a separate project linked above.</sub>

### [CyClaw Net Viewer](https://github.com/cgfixit/Mac-NetViewer-EZview) · macOS network visibility

<sub>Latest project · Created September 6, 2026 · Repository: Mac-NetViewer-EZview</sub>

A TCPView-inspired desktop app and CLI for seeing which processes own TCP/UDP connections on a Mac. Built to inspect network activity while working on CyClaw's telemetry controls.

- **Inspect connections:** process names, PIDs, IPv4/IPv6 endpoints, connection states, and an off-box filter.
- **Follow changes:** color-coded connection events, background DNS resolution, and CSV exports.
- **Use either interface:** an egui desktop app and a scriptable CLI, with macOS packaging for Apple Silicon and Intel.

**Stack:** Rust · egui/eframe · macOS socket APIs<br />

### [Veeam YARA Scanner](https://github.com/cgfixit/Veeam-PS1-Scanner-Yara-Rule-Detection-Onion-Links) · recovery inspection

PowerShell and YARA tooling for inspecting mounted recovery data for ransomware-related indicators before it returns to service.

- **Look for suspicious infrastructure:** Tor, I2P, and Freenet indicators with context-aware rules.
- **Support investigation:** structured JSON findings, matched strings, and scan logs for recovery and security workflows.
- **Exercise failure paths:** Pester tests cover scanner logic and mocked Veeam integration; YARA fixtures cover detections and false-positive exclusions.

**Stack:** PowerShell · YARA · Veeam · Pester<br />

### [Veeam Proxy Maintenance](https://github.com/cgfixit/sccm-veeam-proxy-patching) · coordinated patch windows

Coordinates VMware backup proxies around SCCM/ConfigMgr maintenance from a VBR server or management host.

- **Drain before stopping:** disable selected proxies, wait for their active tasks, then stop services.
- **Restore availability:** restart services and re-enable proxies in a separate post-maintenance stage.
- **Give operators a result:** configurable timeouts, logs, preview support, and SCCM-aware exit codes.

**Stack:** PowerShell · Veeam · SCCM/ConfigMgr · WinRM · VMware<br />

## How I build

- **Start with an operational constraint.** A backup task must finish before maintenance; a local AI request needs explicit permission before using a cloud provider.
- **Put controls in the implementation.** Use scoped access, validation, confirmation gates, and inspectable logs.
- **Test the failure paths.** Cover timeouts, malformed input, unavailable dependencies, and denied actions alongside normal operation.
- **Make the next step clear.** Provide usable interfaces, setup instructions, examples, and reviewable output.
